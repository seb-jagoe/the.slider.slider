# the.slider.slider
It's a slider slider. Simply slide the slider to slide the slider. 

This project was copied from a far superior coder, Mark Adam Benzan. See the original here: https://codepen.io/clawtros/pen/mWWRwv Be sure to check out his other projects!

I remade his project using only HTML and CSS as a quick challenge, and because I thought it was a really funny concept.
